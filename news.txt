{"version":"24","news":[{"title":"Timetables updates","description":"Dear all,\r\n\r\nI would like to apologise again for the late timetables update for this month. Unfortunately, these delays might happen at the beginning of each month since I have to wait for the timetables to be available at the mosque's webpage. When this happens, please, patiently wait a few days; they will appear in the app eventually during the first days of the month.\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding in this matter.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nHarrow Central Mosque app developer","dayDue":1,"monthDue":10,"yearDue":2020}]}
